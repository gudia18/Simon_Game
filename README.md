# Simon_Game
Remember the Simon game with colored buttons that you used to play? Well, here's a digital version! It challenges your memory by making you repeat sequences of colors and sounds. The game gets trickier as you go. Just clone the repository, start playing, and have some fun reliving the classic Simon game!
